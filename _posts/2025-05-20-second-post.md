# Second Step

For the second step, I've put this page up on GitHub pages!

Figuring it out was easy! GitHub Pages makes it simple. 

Now figuring out how to use git, that was the hard part. Still not too bad though! The cli has done away with username and password auth so instead I used VSCodes built in to push it over to the repo. Pretty neat.

**Actually** I met a pretty annoying bug having to do with the title on the first page. So we'll see if I fix that with my next push or if I put it off. Either way, at least this thing is on the web!

Next up, getting my domain to point to the page hosted on GitHub.

Stay tuned!
