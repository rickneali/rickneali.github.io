I've finally setup my Surface Pro 6 with linux. I tried Arch, but honestly I was looking for something simple. So now it has Ubuntu and most things work out of the box! Maybe one day I'll go on ebay and get a Dell or something, but for now this is what I got.

Now that I have jekyll setup, I can learn it. Starting with the basic template. Maybe I'll hate this template and try to learn another one. We'll see. For now. I'm going to learn this one.

Already looking way further than I should, the next roadblock will be hosting this with GitHub Pages, and getting my domain to point to that. Right now my domain is on Squarespace. That's just because it got moved from Google Domains. Hopefully that's an easy process.
